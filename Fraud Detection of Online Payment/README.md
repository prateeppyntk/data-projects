# Fraud Detection of Online Payment Project


## About Project
* This project will handle the imbalanced of dataset using 3 techniques including Oversampling, Undersampling, and SMOTE. and will evaluate each technique by Random Forest Classifier model.

* Perform feature selection using Permutation Feature Importance method and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method.

* Compare the performance of 3 models which are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting when use with each solution (full features, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction). Then we will tune it again for finding the best parameters and also evaluate with test/unseen data.

* Finally, we will observe the model which used PCA how difficult it is to misclassify points.


## Problems
1. Can we classify fraud transactions based on payment details? And what is the best way to integrate the model to achieve high performance?
2. What types of transactions will have the highest amount of fraud?
3. Most of fraud transactions fall between what amounts?


## Tools 
Python
