# Drinker Classification By Body Signal Project


## About Project
We will build a machine learning model to classify drinkers and non-drinkers by using body signals including gender, age, weight, height, blood test results and smoking status. We uses K-Nearest Neighbors Classification model and Logistic Regression model and comparison the performance.


## Objective
1. To classification drinker and not a drinker from body signals.
2. To explore the number of drinkers who have abnormal blood pressure or abnormal blood test results compare with the number of not a drinker.
