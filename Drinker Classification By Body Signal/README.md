# Drinker Classification By Body Signal Project


## About Project
We will build a machine learning model to classify drinkers and non-drinkers by using body signals including gender, age, weight, height, blood test results and smoking status. We uses K-Nearest Neighbors Classification model and Logistic Regression model for prediction. Last, we will compare their performances with test/unseen data.


## Problems
1. Can we use the body signal to distinguish between drinker and non-drinker?
2. Are drinkers more likely to have abnormal blood pressure than non-drinkers?
3. Are drinkers more likely to have abnormal blood test results than non-drinkers?


## Tools 
Python


## Results
The result shows that the performance of Logistic Regression model is higher than K-Nearest Neighbors Classification model with Accuracy = 0.72096 and AUC = 0.800294. So we think that Logistic Regression model is better and suitable for this dataset and task.
